<h2>Hand Detection Shredder Machine Project</h2>

<h2>About this Project:</h2>

<h2>This project is contributed to one of the cement factory company, which is located in Spain.</h2>

<h3>Business Problem:</h3>

In general in the cement factory industry, usually workers are working with Shredder Machine to reproduce the new product from the scrap.

<h3>Business Solution:</h3> 

With the help of DeepLearning using the Object detection model we have developed a model to find hand detection and display alert message to the worker.  
In this project, First it will find the hand detection and then we created a safety border line. 
For suppose, if a person hand cross to safety border line, you will get alert message along with alarming sound to alert the worker, and also it stops the process until that the person has to remove his hand from the safety border line.
